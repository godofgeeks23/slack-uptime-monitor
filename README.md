A simple uptime monitor based on HTTP/HTTPS requests. It can be used to monitor the uptime of your website or any other API. It sends a request to the specified URL at a specified interval and logs the response time and status code. It also logs the downtime if the response status code is not 200.

It also integrates with Slack to send notifications when the website is down or when it is back up.
